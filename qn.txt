A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an
infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization 
identified SARS-CoV-2
as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger 
what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
It can affect your 
upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or
Lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
